      <description>This guide is geared towards readers with a background in modern deep learning.
The problem Lets say we want to generate sound signals. This might happen in different settings. We might have music notes + a instrument and want to generate their sound \(w(\mathrm{note}, \mathrm{instrument}) = \mathrm{sound}\), or we have a text and want to generate the corresponding speech \(w(\mathrm{text}) = \mathrm{sound}\) or maybe we already have a sound signal, but it is noisy and we want to remove the noise \(w(\mathrm{noisy\ sound}) = \mathrm{sound}\).</description>
