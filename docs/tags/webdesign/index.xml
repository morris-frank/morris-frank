      <description>In a recent web-design project we decided that we want to prevent spam and other leakage of information by hiding away that content (e.g. the mail-address) behind a CAPTCHA. Now that web-site up until that point was a completly static site (build with Hugo) even lacking any scripting. As I am a staunch defender of keeping static content static, I wanted to absolutely avoid having to admister a server and maybe even porting this simple site to some for of dynamic CMS.</description>
