        <h2>Personalize your keyboard layout</h2>
        <p>
            I adjusted my own keyboard layout and you should too. Here we will quickly see
            how/why to write a <a href="https://w.wiki/DWZ">XKB</a> (X keyboard extension)
            layout file to extend ones keyboard layout.

        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>
            That's easy. The keyboard layout tells your system which character / symbol to
            print, when you press a key.
        </p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            Most people that start going down this path and ask <em>Which keyboard layout
                should I use?</em> probably end up with one of the modern optimized layouts,
            like <a href="https://w.wiki/DWJ">Neo</a> (German only). The argument being, that
            the layout most of use like QWERTY (or QWERTZ, etc.) sucks and makes you type
            slower. Which is true. Those layouts were invented to be slow, in a time of
            typewriters, so that commonly used keys have a higher distance between each
            other and jam less often. Thus it shouldn't be surprising that one can easily
            construct a layout which is <em>way</em> more efficient. I personally never felt
            though, that the my typing speed was holding me back. I just do not write enough
            (or think fast enough) to require those kinds of speeds. Nevertheless I found my
            keyboard always to be severely underutilized. All those symbols reachable with
            <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>AltGr</kbd>, that I never need, could be symbol I do
            need.
        </p>

        <p>The symbols I added that proved especially useful:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Greek letters (<kbd>Œ±</kbd>, <kbd>Œ≤</kbd>, <kbd>Œ≥</kbd>, ‚Ä¶). I use them
                extensively in writing and programming. As Python is ok with most
                unicode symbols as variable names you can code more expressively:
                <pre class=" language-python"><code class=" language-python">œÄ <span class="token operator">=</span> np<span class="token punctuation">.</span>pi
œÜ <span class="token operator">=</span> np<span class="token punctuation">.</span>random<span class="token punctuation">.</span>randint<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">360</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
x <span class="token operator">=</span> Œº <span class="token operator">+</span> np<span class="token punctuation">.</span>random<span class="token punctuation">.</span>rand<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> œÉ</code></pre>
                which is especially useful in the kind of mathematical, research code I
                am writing often. (Of course this is more for personal code, if your
                collaborators are not doing the same or are Greek).
            </li>
            <li>
                Mathematical / logic notation. With <kbd>‚áî</kbd>, <kbd>‚à•</kbd>,
                <kbd>¬∑</kbd>, <kbd>¬¨</kbd>,<kbd>‚àß</kbd>, <kbd>‚à®</kbd> etc. it is quite
                easier to communicate math or logic with other people quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Emoticons <kbd>ü§∑</kbd>. Yes, it is 2019 and on my phone I can quickly
                add smileys to a message but chatting on the computer that is
                <em>clearly</em> a lacking possibility. As emoticons are Unicode
                standard we can add what we need <kbd>üëçüëçüëç</kbd>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bringing dead keys alive. Some keys in a standard keyboard layout are
                so-called <a href="https://w.wiki/DWX">dead keys</a>. E.g the grave
                accent <kbd>`</kbd>. Now for me I need the grave way more commonly as a
                single symbol not as a accent (‚áí <kbd>√†</kbd>), you might be the same.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Many of the symbols I use together with <a href="https://morris-frank.dev/latex-macros">
                LaTeX macros so I can write mathematical text:</a>
        </p>


        <pre class=" language-latex"><code class=" language-latex"><span class="token function selector">\œÉ</span>_i = <span class="token function selector">\√∑</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token function selector">\exp</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token function selector">\œÜ</span>_i<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token function selector">\Œ£</span>_j <span class="token function selector">\exp</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token function selector">\œÜ</span>_j<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>

        <h3>How?</h3>
        <p>
            We do not want to reinvent the wheel. We just want to replace symbols that we
            never use with symbols that could be useful. Therefore it is best to start off
            with a pre-existing layout. For me that would be the German QWERTZ layout. You
            find all XKB layout definitions in <samp>/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols</samp>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking into any of those files (e.g. <samp>symbols/de</samp>) you will find
            blocks of the form:
        </p>

        <pre>default
xkb_symbols "basic" {

    include "latin(type4)"
    include "kpdl(comma)"
    include "level3(ralt_switch)"

    name[Group1]="German";

    ‚Ä¶
};</pre>

        <p>
            The xkb layout definitions are hierarchical, we can include other definitions
            with an include statement and override only the parts that we need. The <em>de</em>
            layout is based on the type4 layout (which itself has latin as its base) in the
            file <samp>symbols/latin</samp>. Further included is <var>level3(ralt_switch)</var>
            which will make <kbd>Alt</kbd> the modifier with which the third layer is
            reached.
        </p>

        <p>The inside of the block consists of lines like:</p>

        <pre>    key &lt;AE04&gt; { [ 4, dollar, onequarter, currency ] };</pre>

        <p>
            in the angle brackets we have the XKB key symbol we want to define followed
            by a list with the four levels: no modifier, <kbd>Shift</kbd>, <kbd>RAlt</kbd>,
            <kbd>RAlt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> (for this German case).
        </p>


        <h3>Our own layout</h3>
        <p>
            We start by just importing the German basic layout (which imports all
            underlying imports):
        </p>

        <pre>default
xkb_symbols "basic" {
    include "de(basic)"

    name[Group1]="German Edited";

    ‚Ä¶
};</pre>

        <p>
            If you want to have a different modifier than <kbd>RAlt</kbd> for level3 you
            have to import the definition from <samp>symbols/level3</samp>. Now we need the
            XKB symbol names for the keys we are interested in. For this you can run inside
            a terminal:
        </p>

        <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">xev -event keyboard</code></pre>

        <p><samp>xev</samp> is included in the <em>x11-utils</em> package.</p>

        <p>
            <samp>xev</samp> gives you a little white window and if you press a key inside
            it, it will print information about the pressed key in the terminal. We are
            interested in the <em>keycode</em>. If I press my <kbd>F</kbd> key it will
            give me keycode 41. Sadly that is the keycode not the <em>key-symbol</em>. To
            find the key symbol you have to look in <samp>/usr/share/X11/xkb/keycodes/evdev</samp>.
            In there we find that the key symbol for key code 41 is <var>&lt;AC04&gt;</var>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As quick rule for the rows of the keyboard: The number row is <var>&lt;AE##&gt;</var>
            (Key 1 ‚áí &lt;AE01&gt;), and the three letter rows are from top to bottom
            <var>&lt;AD##&gt;</var>, <var>&lt;AC##&gt;</var> and <var>&lt;AB##&gt;</var>
            (Key Q ‚áí &lt;AD01&gt;, Key A ‚áí &lt;AC01&gt;, Key Y/Z ‚áí &lt;AB01&gt; for QWRTY/Z).
            Inside the rows the numbers increase to the right.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we want to update our F key to have the Greek small and big Phi on the third
            and fourth layer so we write:
        </p>

        <pre>key &lt;AC04&gt; { [ f, F, Greek_phi, Greek_PHI] };</pre>

        <p>
            We write <var>Greek_phi</var> instead of œÜ. Except the absolute basic numbers
            and latin alphabet you cannot write copy symbol you want but have to use an
            identifier. A subset of Unicode symbols have defined names in X11. A list of
            those given names is in <samp>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</samp>.
            You can use any name from this header file, ignoring the leading <em>XK_</em>.
            More realistically you can also look in other layout files from <samp>xkb/symbols</samp>.
            Besides the given names you may use any Unicode character. For üëç that will
            give you <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/1F44D/">U+1F44D</a> which you can
            use in the form <var>U1F44D</var> inside the layout. You can also use the Unicodes
            instead of the given X11 names (loosing some readability‚Ä¶).
        </p>

        <p>
            Change all the keys you need, put them into the <em>xkb_symbols</em> block and
            save the file to somewhere, lets say <samp>deedit</samp>. Next you can install the file into the symbols
            directory:
        </p>

        <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash"><span class="token function">sudo</span> <span class="token function">install</span> -Dm644 deedit /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/deedit</code></pre>

        <p>
            It is probably a better idea to make a package out of your layout for which
            you can check your distros documentation (‚áí for Arch Linux: <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD">PKGBUILD</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/morris-frank/xkb-demod/blob/master/PKGBUILD">example</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly you change your current Keyboard layout and try it out:
        </p>

        <pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">setxkbmap deedit</code></pre>

        <p>
            If your happy with it and want to make it stick, append the previous line to
            your <samp>xinit.rc</samp> so that it is loaded on every boot.
        </p>
