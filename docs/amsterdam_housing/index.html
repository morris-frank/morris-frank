                <h1>Student housing in Amsterdam is broken and its the governments fault</h1>

                <blockquote>NO STUDENTS, NO SHARING</blockquote>
                <p>
                    Many students in the Netherlands but especially in Amsterdam will bitterly have seen those four words many times.
                    They are the start of almost any ad for a flat or house on the free housing market.
                    Now I am sure there are landlords that categorially do not want to have students on their properties but all of them?
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, sadly the reason is actually worse than a city wide distrust for co-living university students.
                    The housing laws forbid landlords to rent out a property to more than two people.
                    Breaking this rule can result in a police raid which will kick out the un-registered illegal residents and a fine of up to 15.000 EUR.
                    The city government does make sure that the number of residents in the register matches the number of allowed residents and will call the police otherwise.
                    Housing laws want to make sure that students are not forced into inappropiate housing which is not adequate for multiple grown adults.
                    This post asks what is better: suboptimal housing or no place to live?
                </p>

                <h2>Where students live</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to quickly give a heads up in what kind of living situations students actually end up with.
                    As they are forbidden to engage in the free housing market most rely on the mercy of university to grant them a room in a student dormitory or they go for one of the private student housing companies.
                    The waiting list for a normal student room in Amsterdam is somewhere above two years which makes sure that atleast almost no international student will ever get a room this way.
                    Nevertheless the University can give out dormitory rooms from its own restricted set of rooms.
                    I myself lived in multiple ones of those.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I lived outside Amsterdam in a private holiday park in a bungalow in which two students had to sleep in a room of 4 sq meters (400 EUR).
                            It was a calm nice place and fine 35km of biking everyday.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A friend of mine got a room in an actually recently closed <i>prison</i>.
                            It did not anymore fullfill the humanitarian standards for a prison but it was enough to charge students 400 EUR for a cell.
                            At times they where missing hot water or internet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another friend got an offer to live in a student dormitory which consisted of <i>one single room</i> for three people (no seperate kitchen or living room, 350 EUR).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Now we do not complain and we are grateful for those sleeping places and we would take any of them again if it was possible.
                    They do though visualize the insanly hypocritical situation.
                    On the one hand somehow it is inhuman for a student to share full house with two friends including seperate living room, kitchen and garden with a price per square meter of 17 EUR.
                    On the other hand they are given privacy-missing shared rooms with square meter prices of sometimes more than 40 EUR.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is noted that there are private, independent student housing complexes.
                    They are mostly in great shape and not too expensive.
                    They are only a drop in the bucket though as they are few.
                    In our (computer science) studies this resulted in students programming bots scraping those sites for the seldmoly appearing free rooms thus prohibiting students from other studies to ever having a chance of getting such a room.
                    Also the government has to ask itself if it wants to give financial subsidies to companies like Greystar.
                    Their student housing complex jacks up rental prices with service fees just under the rental limit of the housing allowance (huurtoeslag).
                    As such the students are fine with a room rent of 800 EUR as they only have to pay around 500 EUR and the owner can pocket the allowance.
                </p>

                <h2>What the laws aimed for</h2>
                <p>
                    It is hard to image how much one has to be disengaged from reality to be able to take the assumption these laws could loosen the socio-ecnoomic pressure on the popoulance (in this case students).
                </p>

                <h2>What should be done</h2>
                <h3>Reverse the laws</h3>
                <p>
                    The laws forbid students to arrange their own housing.
                    Any other explanation of this situation is a lousy excuse.
                    These students are either way forced to live under supotimal living condtions as in the official student housing.
                    Let them engage in the open housing market.
                    Take them the fear of ruining their lifes over a fee for living unregistered.
                </p>

                <h3>Build houses, stupid</h3>
                <p>
                    Build more student housing, it is that easy.
                    <i>But isn't that expensive?</i>
                    I am sorry but its not.
                    Quite a lot of the student dormitories in Amsterdam are actually cheaply build stacked flats of containers.
                    Now thats totally fine and reasonably but for sure it must be one of the cheapest way to build new housing.
                    How do I know?
                    I am part of student run project/company (in Germany) to build <a href="https://collegiumacademicum.de">sustainable, high quality student housing</a>.
                    This project being on a high quality standard is not comparable to the student housing you would find in Amsterdam and still its financeable.
                    Nobody is asking for loss-payed fancy dormitories like that.
                    Build the containers but build more of them, they are cheap, they turn a profit and they can be completed in probably two years including the planning phase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I cannot tell why the unviversities in Amsterdam are not themselves putting up any housing but completly rely on outside companies to do that.
                    That is probably another story with different reasons but I look next to Science Park on a absolute prime spot where a private company was allowed to build some low-rise dormitories.
                    Why the university did not use this perfect sport to build some actually high-rise, high-density housing I cannot understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As basically all not-lobby sponsored articles on city housing I will point to the great city of Vienna for an example of successfull housing laws.
                    Maybe the Finacial Times of the FAZ will tell you it is impossible to have a big city without overpriced laissez-faire housing market but take a look and ask why is Vienna repeatadly voted most liveable city on earth.
                </p>


                <p>
                    In the end I wanna make it clear I am not asking for freebies from the government but just want to provide a reality check.
                    Amsterdam promotes itself as an international metropolitan city.
                    Its an amazing vibrant place, open to the world and un-comparably progressive.
                    The situation in the housing market is a stain on this great city.
                    The city wants to grow?
                    That means more people that means more housing that means higher density.
                    Thats a reality of city life that cities all over the world struggle with but it is unavoidable.
                    Amsterdam is quite tiny if you take a global viewpoint and still it somehow manages to pull itself into a housing crisis.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can view this as a cry for help.
                    The regulatory frame of the student housing puts all students under almost constant fear and worry.
                    Maybe they fear a fine that could ruin their live.
                    Maybe they worry because they return from holidays without having a place to live except a hostel (which by the way is also illegal).
                    Amsterdam is great but I am increasingly convinced that this does not make up these troubles.
