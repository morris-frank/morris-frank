      <title>Using plots as ticks in PyPlot</title>

      <description>Why? I was building a heatmap showing some result on different signal sources. The signals where different simple curves: sinus, triangle, square and saw-tooth waves. Now for annotating the plot, yes you could write down the names of the signals on the axis and yes that&amp;rsquo;s probably the &amp;lsquo;correct&amp;rsquo; way to do it. But it is ugly and not intuitive if you could also just show the signals:
  How?</description>

      <title>Getting the argument names of a function</title>

      <description>Why? My use-case is as follows: I have a plotting function which takes a variable number of signals and plots them in an organized little plot:
def plot_data(*signals: torch.Tensor): ... The organization of those plots I can infer from the data, but it would also be nice to label the plots with a legend. The pythonic way to do this, is either to accept another argument with a list of labels or give the signals in a dictionary with the labels as the keys.</description>

      <title>Personalize your keyboard layout</title>

      <description>What is it? That&amp;rsquo;s easy. The XKB (X keyboard extension) layout tells your system which character/symbol to print, when you press a key on your keyboard.
Why? Most people that start going down this path and ask Which keyboard layout should I use? probably end up with one of the modern optimized layouts, like Neo (German only). The argument being, that the layout most of use like QWERTY (or QWERTZ, etc.</description>

      <title>Using a LaTeX macro package</title>

      <description>If you never have written a TeX package, here the short-form with only the stuff we need. You start the file with
\NeedsTeXFormat{LaTeX2e}[1994/06/01] \ProvidesPackage{YOUR-PACKAGE-NAME} end it with
\endinput and save it with extension .sty instead of .tex.
Things to add  Packages you always include. For example which fonts to use. In a package .sty file you use \RequirePackage instead of \usepackage to include other packages. \RequirePackage{newpxtext} \RequirePackage{mathpazo} \RequirePackage{dsfont}  Faster font changes.</description>

      <description>This guide is geared towards readers with a background in modern deep learning.
The problem Lets say we want to generate sound signals. This might happen in different settings. We might have music notes + a instrument and want to generate their sound \(w(\mathrm{note}, \mathrm{instrument}) = \mathrm{sound}\), or we have a text and want to generate the corresponding speech \(w(\mathrm{text}) = \mathrm{sound}\) or maybe we already have a sound signal, but it is noisy and we want to remove the noise \(w(\mathrm{noisy\ sound}) = \mathrm{sound}\).</description>

      <description>Machine learning WaveNet from scratch 2019-12-02  Today we are building a WaveNet from scratch. The WaveNet is an autoregressive, generative and deep model for audio signals.   Python Using plots as ticks in PyPlot 2020-03-22  Another week another tutorial for something that you never thought about doing. Can we replace the ticks in a PyPlot figure with plots?   Getting the argument names of a function 2020-02-12  Is it possible to get the names of the variables given as positional arguments to a function?</description>

      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t do anything so far therefore there is nothing to report on. Notably exception in medial attention is me being cited by the  as not being able to cook black salsify.
This is not true anymore so here is a working way to cook black salsify:
 Completely peel the salsify. Now it is not black anymore During peeling submerge the peeled parts in a mix of water and lemon juice to keep them fresh Cut the peeled parts up and fry them in olive oil for some minutes.</description>
