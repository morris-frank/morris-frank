### Music

I am learning to make amateurish music. Currently on a mission of one track per week in [Bitwig](https://bitwig.com) (the only professional DAW running on Linux).

See here as it happens:

### Web-design

While I am not a totally seasoned web-designer I have almost a decade of experience in it and also try to bring that to use in good projects that need help. The pages for these projects here where mostly bootstraped and are maintained by me:
