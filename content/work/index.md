> 2020  
> **Problems using deep generative models for probabilistic audio source separation**  
> _published-at: I can't believe it's not better workshops @ NeurIPS 2020_  
> [Maurice Frank](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jCHjpIsAAAAJ), [Maximilian Ilse](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KNJIRGkAAAAJ)  
> [[Paper](https://i-cant-believe-its-not-better.github.io/accepted_papers/)] [[Pre-Print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01761)] [[Code](https://github.com/morris-frank/unsupervised-source-separation)] [[Poster](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morris-frank/thesis-tex/master/poster.pdf)]  
> In invistigation into how good deep generative models behave if cmoing in contact with data not present in their trainings set. Do they know what they do not know?

> 2020  
> **Unsupervised musical source separation**  
> [Maurice Frank](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jCHjpIsAAAAJ)  
> [[Paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morris-frank/thesis-tex/master/main.pdf)] [[Code](https://github.com/morris-frank/unsupervised-source-separation)]  
> A summary and invistigation of recent methods to achieve source separation of musical data unsuspervised (meaning not to use tuples of mixed and unmixed musical examples).

> 2017  
> **One-shot detection in art historical images**  
> [Maurice Frank](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jCHjpIsAAAAJ)  
> [[Paper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morris-frank/ba_latex/master/thesis.pdf)] [[Code](https://github.com/morris-frank/bachelor-thesis)]  
> An early application of using deep feature maps to do one-shot learning, for doing sample-based image retrieval in databases of art-historic images.

### Code

> 2019  
> **NSynth-PyTorch**  
> [[Code](https://github.com/morris-frank/nsynth-pytorch)] [[Original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01279)]  
> A reimplementation of the great NSynth Autoencoder for musical notes proposed by the Magenta team. Moved to pure PyTorch.

### Web-design

While I am not a totally seasoned web-designer I have almost a decade of experience in it and also try to bring that to use in good projects that need help. These projects here where mostly bootstraped and are maintained by me:

<div class="flex">
    <div class="card">
        <div>
            <h4><a href="https://ackersyndikat.org">Das Ackersyndikat</a></h4>
            <p>A new Germany-wide collective trying to make farming in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons">the commons</a> possible again. Buying land and farms and transfering them into a collective owner-structure.</p>
