<h2>Media</h2>

<p>
I didn't do anything so far therefore there is nothing to report on.
Notably exception in medial attention is me being <a href="https://collegiumacademicum.de/presse/2016_03_05_taz-Wie_Familie.pdf">cited</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Tageszeitung"><img class="text-image" src="{{ROOT}}img/taz.svg"></a> as not being able to cook black salsify.
</p>

<p>
This is not true anymore so here is a working way to cook black salsify:
</p>


<em>
<ol>
    <li>Completely peel the salsify. Now it is not black anymore.</li>
    <li>During peeling submerge the peeled parts in a mix of water and lemon juice to keep them fresh.</li>
    <li>Cut the peeled parts up and fry them in olive oil for some minutes. Season.</li>
    <li>Pour them off with more lemon juice and some wine and let it cook shortly.</li>
    <li>Transfer roots from pan to baking dish and bake them for 45min.</li>
    <li>Eat.</li>
</ol>
</em>
