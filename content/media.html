<p>
I didn't do anything so far therefore there is nothing to report on.
Notably exception in medial attention is me being <a href="https://collegiumacademicum.de/presse/2016_03_05_taz-Wie_Familie.pdf">cited</a> by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Tageszeitung"><img class="text-image" src="{{ROOT}}img/taz.svg" alt="Logo of the taz"></a> as not being able to cook black salsify.
</p>

<p>
This is not true anymore so here is a working way to cook black salsify:
</p>


<ol>
    <li><em>Completely peel the salsify. Now it is not black anymore.</em></li>
    <li><em>During peeling submerge the peeled parts in a mix of water and lemon juice to keep them fresh.</em></li>
    <li><em>Cut the peeled parts up and fry them in olive oil for some minutes. Season.</em></li>
    <li><em>Pour them off with more lemon juice and some wine and let it cook shortly.</em></li>
    <li><em>Transfer roots from pan to baking dish and bake them for 45min.</em></li>
    <li><em>Eat.</em></li>
</ol>
