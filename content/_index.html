<p>
Morris is an independent machine learning researcher. He recently graduated from
the research masters Artificial Intelligence at the Universiteit of
Amsterdam. He is an expert in deep learning, especially in generative modelling
even more specifically in models working with sound.
</p>

<p>
Right now he is woring in the intersection of Bioinformatics and Machine Learning.
Working with real-world genetic sequencing data means working in noisy enviroments
looking for incredily weak signals. Hopefully unsupervised representation
learning and geometric deep learning will give us a new direction of working with
human genetics codes.

I am also active member of the <a href="https://collegiumacademicum.de">Collegium
Academicum</a> project group. A non-profit company in Heidelberg, Germany where
we are building a sustainable, innovative and really cool wooden housing complex
for 200 young people.
</p>

<p>
Besides that I like mountains, climbing and making and listening to music.
