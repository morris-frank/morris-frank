<h2>About me</h2>

<div class="avatar"/></div>
<p>
I am currently a M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence student at the Universiteit van
Amsterdam. I am interested in deep learning, especially in generative modelling
even more specifically I like to work with sound.
</p>

<p>
I am also active member of the <a href="https://collegiumacademicum.de">Collegium
Academicum</a> project group. A non-profit company in Heidelberg, Germany where
we are building a sustainable, innovative and really cool wooden housing complex
for 200 young people.
</p>

<p>
Besides that I like mountains, climbing and making and listening to music.
