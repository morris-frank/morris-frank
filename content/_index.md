Hey, there… I am Morris (mʌɽis) and this is my personal homepage. Mostly I am interested in random stuff, so you will find a collection of random stuff on this website.

In the [blog](/blog) is a real random collection of mostly tutorials I found out while building stuff…

Under [art](/art) are some musical and visual art projects (you can call everything art am I right?)…

Under [projects](/projects) you'll find some engineering projects I've been working on.

I am also active member of the [Collegium
Academicum](https://collegiumacademicum.de) project group. A non-profit company in Heidelberg, Germany where
we are building a sustainable, innovative and really cool wooden housing complex
for 200 young people.

Besides that I like mountains, climbing and making and listening to music.
