I am really in love with an app made @ Google Research called [MotionStills](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/06/motion-stills-create-beautiful-gifs.html). It takes little videos that can be stabilized with some quite involved CV algorithm it seems… And the app is super slim… I assume Google will kill it in the future but until then it is super fun to use.
