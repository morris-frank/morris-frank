I didn't do anything so far therefore there is nothing to report on.
Notably exception in medial attention is me being [cited](https://collegiumacademicum.de/presse/2016_03_05_taz-Wie_Familie.pdf) by the <a href="ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Tageszeitung"><img class="text-image" src="/img/taz.svg" alt="Logo of the taz"></a> as not being able to cook black salsify.

This is not true anymore so here is a working way to cook black salsify:

1. _Completely peel the salsify. Now it is not black anymore_
2. _During peeling submerge the peeled parts in a mix of water and lemon juice to keep them fresh_
3. _Cut the peeled parts up and fry them in olive oil for some minutes. Season_
4. _Pour them off with more lemon juice and some wine and let it cook shortly_
5. _Transfer roots from pan to baking dish and bake them for 45min_
6. _Eat._
